## Ideas for protein modeling

**Current Tools**
- ProteinKG25 - a knowledge graph that provides information about a protein's functions, use cases, and involved processes, which can connect to other RELATED proteins
- MSAs - aligned sequences of similar length 
- RSA retriever - involves attention embedding of each sequence, which is then similarity searched to find similar sequences to cross attend to
- Structure - we can leverage 3d structure graphs of proteins, as well as atom-level graphs, to understand secondary and tertiary structure directly
- 

**Current Idea brainstorming**
- CLIP-based architecture?
- Retriever based on similarity from the knowledge graph + relational information
